# TheQ-backend
Test code for the the backend part of the project THE-Q

It is Django server that will serve and store data using RESTful APIs. 
You can use Python3.6.3 or higher. I used Python 3.8.0a0.

Just clone the repository and create a virtual environment.
Install all the dependencies from requirements.txt

Change the settings.py file as per your system, mainly database credentials.

Migrate all the models to your database and run your server to test.

It is not a complete project but just the server side so README is bad and I know this!

Happy Hacking!
